## Installation

### install via pip

To use PyABSA, install the latest version from pip or source code:

```bash
pip install -U pyabsa
```

### install via source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA --depth=1
cd PyABSA 
python setup.py install
```

## Examples

1. Train a model of aspect term extraction

```python3
from pyabsa.functional import ATEPCModelList
from pyabsa.functional import Trainer, ATEPCTrainer
from pyabsa.functional import ABSADatasetList
from pyabsa.functional import ATEPCConfigManager

atepc_config = ATEPCConfigManager.get_atepc_config_english()

atepc_config.pretrained_bert = 'yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1'
atepc_config.model = ATEPCModelList.FAST_LCF_ATEPC
dataset_path = ABSADatasetList.Restaurant14
# or your local dataset: dataset_path = 'your local dataset path'

aspect_extractor = ATEPCTrainer(config=atepc_config,
                                dataset=dataset_path,
                                from_checkpoint='',  # set checkpoint to train on the checkpoint.
                                checkpoint_save_mode=1,
                                auto_device=True
                                ).load_trained_model()


```

2. Inference Example of aspect term extraction

```python3
from pyabsa.functional import ABSADatasetList
from pyabsa.functional import ATEPCCheckpointManager

examples = ['But the staff was so nice to us .',
            'But the staff was so horrible to us .',
            r'Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ` perks \' were great .',
            'It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !',
            'It was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , '
            'the food -LRB- from appetizers to entrees -RRB- was delectable .',
            'How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners !'
            ]

inference_source = ABSADatasetList.Restaurant14
aspect_extractor = ATEPCCheckpointManager.get_aspect_extractor(checkpoint='multilingual2')
atepc_result = aspect_extractor.extract_aspect(inference_source=inference_source,
                                               save_result=True,
                                               print_result=True,  # print the result
                                               pred_sentiment=True,  # Predict the sentiment of extracted aspect terms
                                               )

```

3. Get available checkpoints from Google Drive

PyABSA will check the latest available checkpoints before and load the latest checkpoint from Google Drive. To view
available checkpoints, you can use the following code and load the checkpoint by name:

```python3
from pyabsa import available_checkpoints

# The results of available_checkpoints() depend on the PyABSA version
checkpoint_map = available_checkpoints()  # show available checkpoints of PyABSA of current version 
```

If you can not access to Google Drive, you can download our checkpoints and load the unzipped checkpoint manually.

with great contribution from community researchers.
We expect that you can help us improve this project, and your contributions are welcome. You can make a contribution in
many ways, including:

- Share your custom dataset in PyABSA and [ABSADatasets](https://github.com/yangheng95/ABSADatasets)
- Integrates your models in PyABSA. (You can share your models whether it is or not based on PyABSA. if you are
  interested, we will help you)
- Raise a bug report while you use PyABSA or review the code (PyABSA is a individual project driven by enthusiasm so
  your help is needed)
- Give us some advice about feature design/refactor (You can advise to improve some feature)
