 Ran Heck, a farmer who grows both soybean and corn on 4,000 acres said. Most farmers own silos made out of iron sheets but the $T$ prefer concrete silos, which are better for temperature control and bigger storage capacity. From Iowa State, in the US, Ugandan farmers may need to learn some lessons to improve Ugandan farmers's post-harvest handling by owning simple storage facilities, including granaries, a traditional way of doing it. Patrick Rubaihayo, professor emeritus of Makerere University, notes that in the past almost all those engaged in farming used to keep almost all those engaged in farming's food in granaries. keep would provide food during lean times as well as seed for the next planting season. During the colonial times, the government constructed houses at every gombolola (Sub-county) where farmers were asked store food collectively. Change in cultureIf a farmer kept a tin of grain, mostly finger millet or sorghum, a farmer would be required to pick a tin of grain, mostly finger millet or sorghum but replace a tin of grain, mostly finger millet or sorghum during harvest time. This activity would be inspected by the chiefs which worked well. It is upon the current government to sensitise farmers about the importance of keeping food in silos, which are affordable to farmers,
